Half Adder

1. The Combinational circuit that performs the addition of two bits is called half adder. ( The name is so because two half adders are required to implement a full adder)

2. A half adder circuit has two binary inputs and two binary outputs (Sum, Carry)

3. It is an arithmetic circuit used to perform the arithmetic operation of addition of two single bit.

4. The Outputs of half adder for different set of inputs is shown below.

	#0  a=x,b=x,sum=x,carry=x
        #5  a=0,b=0,sum=0,carry=0
        #10 a=0,b=1,sum=1,carry=0
        #15 a=1,b=0,sum=1,carry=0
        #20 a=1,b=1,sum=0,carry=1
